% Generate initial values for mu
% K is the number of segments

% Each of is a 3x1 vector that represents a point in
% the L*a*b* space. A possible way to initialize is to
% spread them equally in the L*a*b* space

function mu = generate_mu([input you need], K)
for i = 1:K
    mu = [the mus you generated];
